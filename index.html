<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 25, 2026</p>

<div class="section">
    <p>Welcome to <strong>MY Radio</strong> ("the App"), developed by MingDev ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our App.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<div class="section">
    <h3>1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
    <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device using SharedPreferences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Last selected radio channel ID</strong> — This is a simple numeric identifier stored locally so the App can remember your last played channel and resume it when you reopen the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored only on your device and is <strong>not transmitted</strong> to any server.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Network Data</h3>
    <p>The App requires an internet connection to stream radio content. When streaming:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your device connects to third-party radio stream servers to receive audio content.</li>
        <li>Standard network information (such as your IP address) may be visible to the radio stream providers as part of normal internet communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> operate these radio stream servers and do <strong>not</strong> collect or store your network data.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li>Contacts, photos, or any other personal files</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>2. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>

    <ul>

    </ul>
</div>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services and SDKs</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>The App integrates the following third-party SDK:</p>

    <h3>3.2 Radio Stream Providers</h3>

</div>

<h2>4. Permissions Used</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>The App requests the following Android permissions:</p>

        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</strong> (Android 13+) — Required to display playback control notifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of these permissions are used to collect personal data.</p>
</div>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal data with any third parties. The only data interaction involves standard network requests to radio stream servers for audio playback.</p>
</div>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>The channel preference data (last selected channel ID) is stored locally on your device and persists until you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear the App's data through your device settings, or</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> You can delete all locally stored data by clearing the App's data in your device Settings &gt; Apps &gt; MY Radio &gt; Storage &gt; Clear Data, or by uninstalling the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawal of consent:</strong> You can revoke any permissions (such as notification permission) at any time through your device Settings &gt; Apps &gt; MY Radio &gt; Permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> Since the only stored data is your last selected channel ID (a simple number), you can view this by inspecting the App's data. No personal information is collected.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>8. Account System</h2>

</div>

<h2>10. Data Security</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the limited data stored by the App. Since the App stores only a channel preference locally and does not transmit personal data, the security risks are minimal. All radio streaming is performed over standard network protocols.</p>
</div>

    <p>The App complies with applicable data protection laws and regulations, including but not limited to:</p>
